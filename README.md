This ackee cookbook contains know-how of node.js development. If you tried to find some food related recipe, don't worry, we have created cookbook based on this cookbook, which can be accessed with REST API, described on [apiary][1].

We like to share our ideas and experience with everyone! Also it is good to have best practices all in one place.
